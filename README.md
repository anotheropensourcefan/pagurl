Sometimes you want to reference a webpage, and sometimes you want to write more about this webpage **in its own note**.

1. Put your cursor anywhere inside a link: [hello world](https://hello-world.com)
2. Command Palette -> Pagurl
   Pick a folder (defined in settings)
3. A new note has been created, with "url" and "aliases" properties
   Modify the new note as you wish (including its title)
   Keep intact the "aliases" property

Feel free to **contribute**!
